# The Analysis

## 1. What are the most demanded skills for the top 3 popular data roles?

To identify the most in-demand skills, the top three most commonly posted data job roles were filtered based on job listing frequency. For each role, the five most frequently mentioned skills were extracted to get a better idea of what employers are really looking for. This makes it easier to focus on the right skills depending on the role being targeted.

Detailed steps and analysis can be found in the notebook: [2_Skill_Demand.ipynb](2_Project\2_Skill_Demand.ipynb)

### Visualizing Data
```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(len(job_titles), 1)

for i, job_title in enumerate(job_titles):
    df_plot = df_skills_perc[df_skills_perc['job_title_short']==job_title].head(5)
    sns.barplot(data=df_plot, y='job_skills',x='skills_percentage', ax=ax[i], hue='skills_percentage', palette='dark:r_r')
    sns.set_theme(style='ticks')
    ax[i].set_title(job_title)
    ax[i].set_ylabel('')
    ax[i].set_xlabel('')
    ax[i].legend().remove()
    ax[i].set_xlim(0, 78)

    for n, v in enumerate(df_plot['skills_percentage']):
        ax[i].text(v + 1, n, f'{v:.0f}%', va = 'center')
    
    if i != len(job_titles) -1:
        ax[i].set_xticks([])
    
plt.suptitle('Likelihood of Skills Requested in Job Postings', fontsize = 15)
plt.tight_layout(h_pad=0.5)
plt.show()
```

*Linegraph Visualizing the trending top skills for Data Analysts in the US in 2023.*

### Insights

* SQL remains the most in-demand skill throughout the year, maintaining above 50% likelihood in job postings, though slightly dipping in Q4.

* Excel stays consistently important, showing a steady presence around 40‚Äì42%, with a small dip in October‚ÄìNovember and a bounce back in December.

* Tableau and Python trend closely together, with Tableau slightly leading for most of the year, except a crossover in late summer.

* Python maintains stable demand around 26‚Äì29%, showing its consistent value across the year.

* SAS remains the least requested skill, with likelihood hovering around 20%, showing a steady but lower relevance in the market.

**üìà Notable Changes**

* Excel shows a noticeable dip in October‚ÄìNovember, possibly due to a shift in reporting tools or role requirements late in the year.

* August sees a temporary spike in Tableau demand, suggesting increased need for data visualization during that period.

* Python and Tableau converge in Q4, showing that either tool could be valuable depending on the job listing.

![The Higest Paid & The Most Demanded Skills for Data Analysts in the US](2_Project/images/Salary_Analysis_skills_demand.png)
*Two Seperate Bar Graphs Visualizing the Highest paid skills and most In-Demand skills for Data Analysts in the US*

### Insights 

* High-paying skills such as dplyr, bitbucket, gitlab, and solidity are not among the most commonly requested ones. This suggests that less common or niche tools‚Äîespecially those related to programming workflows, version control, blockchain, or cutting-edge platforms like Hugging Face‚Äîcan command higher salaries due to their specialized nature and lower supply of skilled professionals.

* On the other hand, the most in-demand skills like python, tableau, r, sql, and excel are more foundational or widely used tools in typical data analyst roles. These skills are essential for entering the field, but they may not always lead to the highest salaries, likely due to high supply and broader adoption across industries.

* Tools like power bi, sas, and powerpoint show that employers still value business intelligence and reporting capabilities, reinforcing the importance of communication and visualization skills in analyst roles.

* The contrast between the two charts highlights a valuable takeaway: developing niche or emerging technical skills (e.g., hugging face, couchbase, mxnet) may open doors to higher-paying roles, while mastering core tools (like python, sql, excel) remains critical for landing jobs and staying relevant in the job market.
